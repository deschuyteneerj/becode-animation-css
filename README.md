# CSS Animations

## The animated card
The job was to duplicate an animated card using CSS animations only (not JavaScript).

## Solving the issues
It was difficult for me at the time because I made my HTML too fast and I realised it when I was doing the CSS. So I had to start from zero again in order to create a proper HTML skeleton.

The animations were hard to duplicate, I did my best. It was new for me so I had to think about how I could do the animations.

The most difficult was maybe to reproduce the picture zooming. But also the text appearing in end.

It took several hours but the result is fine and I am proud of it !
